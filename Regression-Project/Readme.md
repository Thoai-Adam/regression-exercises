# Zillow Regression Project

## Goals : 
    * ML Regression model 
        * predict property tax assessed values
    * Key drivers of property
        * why some properties have much higher value than other when they are located so close to each other?
        * Why are some properties valued so differently from others when they havenearly the same physical attributes but only differ in location?
        * Is having 1 bathroom worse for property value than having 2 bedrooms?
    * Report and Conclusion
        * delivery replicatable report and outcomes
        * make recommendation
## Descriptions
    * We want to be able to predict the property tax assessed values('taxvaluedollarcnt') of Single Family Properties that had a transaction during 2017. We need to make a better model with new feature with non-linear regression algorithm, or different model for each county. Identify the states and counties these properties are located in.


## Planning
    * properties that had a transaction in 2017! 
        *filter your data IN SQL  determining which properties before bringing it into your Python environment.
        *You will need to use the properties_2017, predictions_2017, and propertylandusetype tables.
    *Remove landtaxvaluedollarcnt, structuretaxvaluedollarcnt, and taxamount.
